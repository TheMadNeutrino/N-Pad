N-Pad

The N-Pad is a 7-key macropad, equipped with a rotary encoder, OLED screen and 16 addressable LEDs. The heart of this pad is XIAO RP2040, controlled via KMK firmware.
N-Pad compounds of 3 main elements: PCB, Bottom (main) part of the case and the top part.


Features:

    -6 + 1 keys with awesome functions
    -Rotary encoder to modify volume and MUTE function when pressed (the 7th key).
    -128x32 OLED screen displaying the volume level
    -16 addressable LEDs (6 right under the keys and rest and the back side of PCB for even brighter and smoother backlight, fancy light at the USB port too)
    - Years of big software updates coming!

The case is from 2 parts: The bottom part (includes space for PCB with raised platforms). The top has cutouts for key switches, rotary encoder as well as OLED screen and can be easily taken off.

Thanks to the detachable design, no screws are needed for assembly.

Note: The first image shown a PCB with no parts on it, though contacts for keys visible. Designed in OnShape.
